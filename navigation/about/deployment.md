Our project is structured to provide a seamless integration between the frontend and backend. Below is an outline of the current repository setup, including subdomains, and frontend/backend port configuration.

**Backend:** Our backend repository is Flask based and runs on the port 8887 which is used for API requests and is the port we use to test it in postman. It is responsible for processing data, interactign with the database, and sending responses to frontend (JSON). The backend contains each of our APIs under the folder .py which all work through our main.py. Each of our APIs has a corresponding model under the model folder.

**Frontend:** Our frontend communicates the backend through RESTful APIs. The frontend runs on 4887 and sends HTTP requests to the backend. Our frontend is configured to fetch data from backend, process user data, then display it. The frontend 4887 sends API requests to the backend 8887. The backend processes the request, and interacts with the database. The frontend then updates the user interface based on the request.

### **How our Features Interact with the Frontend and Backend**
- REVIEW FEATURE: The backend API handles CRUD operations for the Review model, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete reviews through routes like /api/review. The frontend interacts with these endpoints by sending HTTP requests, such as POST for creating reviews and GET for fetching them, often passing a JWT token for authentication. The backend processes these requests, interacting with the database via SQLAlchemy and returning relevant data to the frontend.

- GEMINI API: The Gemini API integrates with Google Generative AI to provide a chatbot that generates camping-related advice based on user inputs. When a user sends a message, the backend uses the AI model to generate a response, updates the conversation history, and stores both the user input and AI response in the database. The backend supports CRUD operations, allowing users to interact with the chatbot, update messages, and delete them via HTTP requests, while maintaining a persistent chat session.

- QUIZ API: This Flask API handles quiz result submissions, retrieval, updates, and deletions for users, storing the data in the quiz_results table linked to the Frostbyte user model. The frontend sends requests to the /api/quiz endpoints (via HTTP methods like POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) to interact with quiz results, while the backend processes these requests, assigning national parks based on the user's quiz score and managing the results in the database. The frontend can display the assigned national park and allow users to view, update, or delete their quiz results based on their interaction with the API.

- LOCATION API: The Location API allows the frontend to manage user-specific location data, including storing, retrieving, and deleting location information linked to users and channels. It provides endpoints for creating and updating locations, fetching a user's location by their ID and channel, and deleting specific location records by ID. The backend uses SQLAlchemy to interact with the Location model, which stores location data in the database and ensures that each user's location is properly tracked, while utilizing JWT token-based authentication.

- ANALYTICS API: The Analytics API allows the frontend to send and retrieve analytics data related to user reviews, such as star ratings for specific channels. Users can submit individual or bulk analytics entries, which are stored in the database, while the frontend can also request an overall summary of average ratings and review counts for each channel. The backend ensures proper validation and error handling for all requests, and provides CRUD operations for managing analytics data, which is stored in the Analytics model and can be queried for reporting purposes.

- POST API: The Post API allows the frontend to create, update, retrieve, and delete posts associated with specific channels and users. The backend handles these requests by interacting with the Post model, which is stored in a SQL database using SQLAlchemy, ensuring each post has a title, comment, content, and references to the user and channel. Through CRUD operations, the frontend can send requests to create posts, view individual or multiple posts, or delete posts, with responses being returned in JSON format for seamless integration with the frontend interface.


**Subdomain** To ensure that the frontend can communicate with the backend during development, we configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Since the frontend and backend are running on different ports, we need to explicitly allow the frontend to make requests to the backend. CORS Configuration in Flask: The Flask backend is configured to allow requests from the frontend port (127.0.0.1:4887). This ensures that the browser doesnâ€™t block the API requests due to cross-origin restrictions.



### **Ideal final project**

<<<<<<< HEAD
-> Host both the Flask backend and frontend on an AWS EC2 instance, ensuring communication between the two. The deployment should support:  
  
Scalability: Handling Multiple Users Efficiently

    Using multiple workers in gunicorn helps process several requests at the same time, preventing slowdowns.
    Running background tasks with Celery and Redis keeps the main app responsive by handling time-consuming jobs separately.
    Scaling the backend horizontally (adding more instances) using Docker or Kubernetes helps handle more users without overloading a single server.
    Optimizing database performance with connection pooling and caching makes sure queries run quickly, even with many users.

Security: Protecting Data and Access

    Setting up firewall rules blocks unwanted traffic and restricts access to only necessary services.
    Enabling SSL/TLS encryption ensures data sent between users and the server is secure.
    Using JWT tokens, API keys, or OAuth controls who can access different parts of the app.
    Running the app in a secure Docker container with limited permissions reduces security risks.

Reliability: Keeping the Backend Running Smoothly

    Automated deployment with tools like GitHub Actions ensures updates happen without breaking the app.
    Setting up logging and monitoring with tools like Prometheus or Logstash helps track errors and performance issues in real time.
    Using backup strategies and automatic rollbacks prevents downtime in case of failures.

Domain Integration: Routing Traffic Properly

    Setting up a subdomain (e.g., flask2025.nighthawkcodingsociety.com) makes the backend easier to access and keeps it organized.
    Using a reverse proxy (like Nginx) can help direct traffic efficiently while improving security.
    Configuring DNS settings correctly ensures that users can reach the backend without connection issues.


### Deployment Process

Deployment Process Using Docker & Cockpit for a GitHub Pages Frontend & Backend Site

    Prepare the Backend (Flask + Docker)
        Create a Dockerfile in the backend directory to containerize the Flask app.
        Ensure gunicorn is set up to serve the app on a specified port (e.g., 8087).
        Build and test the Docker image locally:

        docker build -t my-backend .
        docker run -p 8087:8087 my-backend

        Push the image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry).

    Deploy the Backend with Cockpit
        Access Cockpit on the server (Cockpit is a web-based Linux server manager).
        Use Podman (or Docker) inside Cockpit to pull and run the backend container.
        Set up the container to restart automatically and expose the correct port.
        Use Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy to route traffic properly to the backend.

    Set Up the Frontend on GitHub Pages
        Ensure the frontend (static files) is inside the docs/ folder or a separate repo.
        Configure the repositoryâ€™s GitHub Pages settings to serve from docs/ or the main branch.
        Update frontend API requests to use the correct backend URL (e.g., https://flask2025.nighthawkcodingsociety.com).

    Domain & Traffic Management
        Set up DNS records to point your custom domain and subdomain to GitHub Pages (frontend) and Cockpit (backend).
        Configure HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for both frontend and backend using GitHubâ€™s built-in SSL for Pages and Let's Encrypt for the backend.

    Monitoring & Updates
        Use Cockpitâ€™s logs and performance metrics to monitor the backend.
        Automate deployment with GitHub Actions to update the backend when pushing new changes.

This setup ensures a smooth deployment process, with GitHub Pages serving the frontend and Docker + Cockpit managing the backend efficiently. ðŸš€


# Deployment Process

### Frontend and Backend Setup: Port 8102

We have set the following configuration in config.yml in frontend: 

<code>```yml
Server: https://flask2025.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/
Domain: nighthawkcodingsociety.com
Subdomain: flask2025
```</code>

In assets/api/config.js, we set: 

<code>
  export var pythonURI;
  if (location.hostname === "localhost" || location.hostname === "127.0.0.1") {
      pythonURI = "http://localhost:8087";  // Same URI for localhost or 127.0.0.1
  } else {
      pythonURI = "https://flask2025.nighthawkcodingsociety.com";
  }
</code>

In the backend, we set these configurations: 

- main.py

    <code>
      if __name__ == "__main__":
          # change name for testing
          app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port="8102")

### How We Will Set UP AWS: 

1. Login with provided credentials
2. Clone our backend repo: (blackstar3092/frostbyte_backend)
3. Our .env file will contain our passwords and Gemini API key, and we will initialize our database with ./scripts/db_init.py
4. To build the docker environment: docker-compose build & docker-compose up -d
5. Finally, we will test our server with curl
        docker ps # looking for port 8102
        curl localhost:8102

Next, we will set up our domain on Route53 (domain will be frostbyte.flask.nighthawkscsp.com) and test DNS through WSL.

Finally, we have already set up Nginx on our backend; we will work on setting it up on the AWS server to function with our backend database, as well as setting up Certbot for authentication.
